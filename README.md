Ancestra-Evolutive
==================

Ancestra Evolutive is my public projet start the 3th of March,
stopped on 20/03/2014 by John-R/Return and taken over by Locos.

I searched to discover more about java, i've seen DAO & mina pattern,
and that's good to improve the emulator (before, 1 player equals 1 thread, now, it's 1 thread to all clients)

I've "import" the lazy-load too, and the emulator load now in 200ms, against 15 000ms (the used memory is improved too).
I've created some tools too, to try abstract/interface class, and that was a good experience :) !
